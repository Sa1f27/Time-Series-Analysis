## Project Overview

This project uses historical store sales data to perform:
- **EDA**: Understand patterns, trends, and anomalies.
- **Machine Learning**: Develop a forecasting model using XGBoost.

The project is structured to provide actionable insights for better decision-making in retail operations.

## Data Description

The dataset contains multiple CSV files, including:
- **train.csv**: Historical sales data for training.
- **test.csv**: Data for testing the model.
- **oil.csv**: Daily oil prices (may impact sales).
- **holidays_events.csv**: Holiday information.
- **stores.csv**: Store metadata.
- **transactions.csv**: Historical transaction data.

Each row in the training data represents sales for a specific product family in a store on a particular day.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Loading**:
   - Loaded datasets using pandas.
   - Merged relevant datasets for comprehensive analysis.

2. **EDA**:
   - Analyzed sales distribution.
   - Identified missing data and unique attributes.
   - Explored seasonal and trend components.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Extracted temporal features (day, month, year).
   - Incorporated external factors like holidays and oil prices.

4. **Modeling**:
   - Built a machine learning pipeline with XGBoost.
   - Validated the model using cross-validation and appropriate metrics.

5. **Visualization**:
   - Created plots using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to visualize trends and model performance.
